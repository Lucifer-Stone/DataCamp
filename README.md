# DataCamp
This repository contains projects (Guided and Unguided) which I have completed in DataCamp

Each project has a brief description about the project in its own respective jupyter notebook.

(1.) A Network Analysis of Game of Thrones : In this project, you will look at the character co-occurrence network and its evolution over the five books in R.R. Martin's hugely popular book series A Song of Ice and Fire (perhaps better known as the TV show Game of Thrones). You will look at how the importance of the characters changes over the books using different centrality measures.
